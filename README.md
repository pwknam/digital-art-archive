### Why I developed the product?

Cloud storage products are not user friendly for artists because they are designed to manage (CRUD) files but not images and videos of artworks and their details (metadata). The “art tech” industry lacks innovative products for artists to digitally manage, store, and showcase their works of physical art.

I created Art Archive for artists to upload images of their artwork, organize artworks by their respective series or collection, and keep track of important details and history of artworks.

### How It's Made

**Technologies Used:**

- Next.js 13
- TypeScript
- Prisma ORM
- NextAuth.js

### Features of the Product

- Artists can create artwork entries of images of their artwork and describe critical details of the work.
- Artists can define series or collections and assign artworks to those series or collections.

## Getting Started

**Installation**

```
npm install
```

**Usage**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Personal Contributions

1. Designed the MVP UX Journey.
2. Designed the lo-fi and hi-fi wireframes in Figma.
3. Developed the entire full-stack web-application
   - Pages
   - API Endpoints
   - Components
   - Database
   - Authorization
   - Session Tokens

## Personal Goals

My personal goal from building this web-application was to learn and practice building with three technologies (Next.js, TypeScript, and Prisma ORM) that are considered the preferred methods of developing large-scale web-applications.

I want to show that I have a curious growth mindset to learn the latest technologies and methods of building modern web-applications. I built this app with Next.js's latest experimental app directory. This app directory folder structure is now Next.js's default and preferred method of building web-applications.
